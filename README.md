func.py: 
	Contains functions that were written to help understand calculus and 
python3 simultaneously.

stats.py:
	Statistics functions written mainly for polynomial regressions. Given a
data set of x and y coordinates, the coefficients of the nth degree polynomial
approximation can be found with the `get_weights` function. Then `poly_f` takes
the weights and an x value and returns the estimated y coordinate. More details
can be found in README.ipynb
